                    In this tutorial, we will explore how to create accordions using CSS. Accordions are an effective
                    way to manage and display large amounts of content on a webpage. They allow users to hide and show
                    sections of content at a time, making the user experience more seamless and interactive.

                    (often by a mouse click). Since this web design pattern highlights only the most critical
                    information of a section but makes the rest easily accessible, it's a common element in responsive
                    design.

                    Each accordion item consists of a header and content. The header contains text and a span element
                    with a class of 'icon'. The 'icon' class contains an arrow symbol that is rotated when the accordion
                    item is clicked. The content is hidden by default.
